\begin_layout Title
Fundametals of Basic Classical Mechanics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The goal of this document is to organize, abstract, and consolidate that
 which is learned typically in a first semester college level, calc based
 physics course.
 More formally, it is define the basic quantities and relations of interest
 in Newtonian Mechanics.
 Electricty and magnitism are considered out of scope, as is more technical
 formulations of Newtonian physics such as Langrangian mechanics.
 We will also discuss and generalize the application of these basic quantities
 and relations to simple systems.
 Focus will be on presenting the material from a first principals point
 of view and finding the essential take away of this subject.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Position and Motion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most unit we will consider in this document is that of the a point particle.
 This point particle exists at a specific point in space given by a 3 dimensiona
l vector over the real numbers.
 We will usually denote this as 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover, a particles state is also described by a time, 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Thus it occupies a point and a time.
 This is a single real number.
 Thus we can usually consider a function 
\begin_inset Formula $x(t)$
\end_inset

 that takes a single real value and outputs a 3 dimensional spacial vector
 describing its position.
 The geometry of this 3+1 space is flat.
 In that the coordinates are not coupled in anyway and simply lie orthognal
 to one another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, we describe motion as simply derivative with respect to time.
 So velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\frac{dx}{dt}$
\end_inset

 is the first derivative of position with respect to time.
 Acceleration 
\begin_inset Formula $a=\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}.$
\end_inset

 We will not further discuss this.
 Finally, a point particle also has an associated quantity mass, 
\begin_inset Formula $m>0$
\end_inset

.
 It is usually taken to be constant with time, but when disucssing collection
 of point particles we can take about mass as a function of time.
 The mass is a measure of how 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hard
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it is to move the particle and how much it resists acceleration.
 This will be formalized with Newton's laws, but as an initial defintion
 mass is a scalar quantity associated with a point particle that gives its
 proprotionality constant to its resistance to motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So with this view of the universe, our world is very simply.
 Everything is composed of infimetisial point particles.
 They are uniquely described by a 3+1 dimensional space-time, an operator
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{d}{dt})$
\end_inset

 which gives its motion through the space, and a scalar quantity describing
 how much this point particle doesn't like to move.
 From this we can describe a wide varity of physical phenonemon and with
 additional laws, can define the ground work for all of classical physics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Newton's Laws
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Newtwon's Laws are three laws which describe how we can set up equations
 that model how our universe we laid out in the previous section will evolve
 with time and what state will evolve through and too.
 Before stating these law's we must introduce an additional construct in
 this universe.
 That is of a force.
 A force intuitivly is just a push or pull.
 It is fomally a 3 dimentional vector quantity that lies in our 3+1 space
 and acts on a point particle.
 It can vary with time and is fomally defined in the second.
 So, these law's are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The velocity of particle will not change unless acted upon by a force
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A force induces an acceleration, inversly proportional to mass: 
\begin_inset Formula $F=ma$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
All forces have an equal and opposite reactionary force
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be noted here that our chose of coordinates is free as long as
 are coordinate frames i,e.
 where we measure postion, velocity, and acceleration from are not exelerating
 relative to one another.
 In other words if you are moving with constant velocity relative to some
 other observer you will observe the same forces and thus dynamics of whatever
 system you are studying.
 So a force is a push or a pull on a point particle, it is a vector, and
 we add the detail that it follows the laws of super posistion.
 That is if more than one force acts on a particle, the resulting dynamics
 are as if a single net force equal to the sum all forces is acting on the
 point particle 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{net}=\sum F_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Now these laws lay out a simple universe.
 Our point particles in this universe do not change velocity unless there
 is a non zero force acting on it.
 A net force governs a particles acceleration.
 And for every force that exists there is an equal and opposite force that
 must also exist (usually on another body).
 Thus we have a recipe for constructing differential equations in our univers.
 First determine the forces acting on a system then simply solve the resulting
 differential equation 
\begin_inset Formula $F=ma$
\end_inset

.
 Easier said than done.
